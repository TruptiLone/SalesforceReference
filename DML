DML (Data Manipulation Language):
Create and modify records in Salesforce by using the Data Manipulation Language, abbreviated as DML. 
DML provides a straightforward way to manage records by providing simple statements to insert, update, merge, delete, and restore records.

DML Insert Operation: 

APEX_Customer__c objCust = new APEX_Customer__c();
objCust.Name='TestABC';
insert objCust;
APEX_Invoice__c objInv = new APEX_Invoice__c();
objInv.APEX_Status__c='Pending';
objInv.APEX_Amount_Paid__c=1000;
objInv.APEX_Customer__c=objCust.id;
insert objInv;
System.debug('The customer we added '+objCust+'and the corresponding invoice for the customer :'+objInv);

DML UPDATE Operation: 

//Fetch the invoice records which we created today
//update the status of the invoice records to Paid if they are not in the paid status
List<APEX_Invoice__c> invoiceList = [Select Id,Name,APEX_status__c,createdDate from APEX_Invoice__c];
//Create a list to store the records which we need to update
List<APEX_Invoice__c> updatedInvoiceList=new List<APEX_Invoice__c>();

for(APEX_Invoice__c obj:invoiceList){
    if(obj.APEX_status__c!='paid'){
        obj.APEX_status__c='paid';
        updatedInvoiceList.add(obj);
    }
}
update updatedInvoiceList;
System.debug('List has been updated and updated value of records are: '+updatedInvoiceList);

Note: Always add the records that needs to be updated to a list and then write a single DML statement to update that List

DML UPSERT Operation: 

//Fetch the record we wanted to update
//Update the description of record with external id 1234
//create 10 more customer records
//Create a list of record we want to create or update
List<APEX_Customer__c> customerList = new List<APEX_Customer__c>();
APEX_Customer__c cus =[SELECT id, APEX_External_Id__c, APEX_Customer_Description__c from APEX_Customer__c where
                           APEX_External_Id__c = '1234'];
cus.APEX_Customer_Description__c = 'Hello How are you?';
customerList.add(cus);
for(Integer i =1; i<10; i++){
    APEX_Customer__c objcust= new APEX_Customer__c(Name = 'Test'+i,APEX_External_Id__c = '1234'+i);
   customerList.add(objcust); 
}
upsert customerList;


DML DELETE Operation: 

//Fetch all the records whose name starts with Test
List<apex_customer__c> customerList = [SELECT id from apex_customer__c where apex_customer__c.name LIKE 'Test%'];
delete customerList;
System.debug ('Success '+customerList.size()+'has been deleted');

DML UNDELETE Operation:

//Fetch all the records whose name starts with Test
List<apex_customer__c> fetchdeletedCustomer = [SELECT id from apex_customer__c where apex_customer__c.name LIKE 'Test%' ALL ROWS];
undelete fetchdeletedCustomer;
System.debug ('Success '+fetchdeletedCustomer.size()+' records has been restored');
