## Project Development

### **1. Planning & Design:**
The project began with detailed planning and wireframing of the user interface. It was important to ensure both a smooth buyer journey and an easy-to-use product management interface for sellers. The design followed the best practices for e-commerce apps, ensuring accessibility, usability, and performance.

### **2. Front-End Development:**
The user interface was built using **Salesforce Lightning Components**, which allowed for a component-based architecture that ensures reusability and easy maintenance. The front-end was focused on creating a user-friendly browsing experience with clear product displays, filter options, and easy cart management.

### **3. Back-End Development:**
On the back-end, **APEX Controllers** were used to manage the logic behind product uploads, inventory management, order placement, and workflows. Salesforce’s **Data Modeling** ensured that all the product and order information was stored in structured, easy-to-access objects, with relationships between products, orders, and customers.

### **4. Workflow & Automation:**
**Salesforce Workflow** and **Process Builder** were leveraged to automate key processes such as order placement notifications and inventory updates. This reduced the need for manual intervention, making the app efficient and scalable.

### **5. Integration:**
The integration for displaying **multiple currencies** was developed using external currency conversion APIs. This ensured that international buyers could view product prices in their native currency and feel confident about the transaction.

### **6. Salesforce Community Integration:**
A **Salesforce Community Page** was created to enhance customer engagement by featuring plants, highlighting plant care tips, and providing a space for buyers to connect with the brand. The community page helped build a loyal customer base and provided valuable educational content about plant care.
