Traversing the Relationship fields:

Suppose you are creating an invoice and you want to relate that invoice to the customer
//Create a invoice record and we will relate this to customer Object
Apex_Invoice__c objInvoice = new Apex_Invoice__c();
objInvoice.Apex_Customer__c=[select Id from APEX_Customer__c 
                             where Name ='Customer Creation Test'
                            LIMIT 1].Id;
objInvoice.APEX_Status__c='pending';
insert objInvoice;
system.debug('Newly created invoice'+objInvoice);

Fetching Child Records

List<APEX_Customer__c> ListCustomers= [Select name,Id,(Select id, name from Invoices__r) 
 from APEX_Customer__c where Name = 'ABC Customer'];
System.debug('List Customers :'+ListCustomers);
List<apex_Invoice__c> listOfInvoices = ListCustomers[0].Invoices__r;  //this is the notation to fetch child records

System.debug('The invoice records related to ABC Customer '+listOfInvoices);


Fetching Parent Records

//fetch the parent record using SOQL

List<apex_invoice__c> ListOfInvoicesWithCustomerName = new List<apex_invoice__c>();
ListOfInvoicesWithCustomerName=[select id, name, Apex_Customer__r.Name from apex_invoice__c LIMIT 10];
for(apex_invoice__c objInv:ListOfInvoicesWithCustomerName){
    System.debug('Invoice customer name is '+objInv.Apex_Customer__r.Name);
}
